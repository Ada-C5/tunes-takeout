# Tunes and Takeout
This is a Rails project designed for students to gain experience building websites that make use of 3rd-party *web services* through *web APIs*.

The major requirement for this project is to integrate both the Yelp Search API and the Spotify API, combining the two into a website that suggests pairings of food and music.
